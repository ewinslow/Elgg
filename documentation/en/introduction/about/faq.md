== What is Elgg? ==

Elgg is a social networking framework. It provides the necessary functionality to allow you to run your own social networking site, whether publicly (like Facebook) or internally on a networked intranet (like Microsoft Sharepoint).

To run Elgg, you need to have your own web server and a certain amount of technical knowledge - or access to someone who does, like a system administrator. (There are more detailed requirements [[Installation/Requirements|over here]].)

There is also a [http://demo.elgg.org demo site] running a standard installation of Elgg.

== What features do I get? ==

Elgg comes with advanced user management and administration, social networking, cross-site tagging, powerful access control lists, internationalisation support, multiple view support (eg cell phones, iPhone), an advanced templating engine, a widget framework and more. A full list is available here [[Features]].

If you need more functionality than what Elgg offers out-of-the-box there are a couple of options:

* Add more by [[Configuration/Plugins|installing plugins]] - for example, blogs, forums, social bookmarks
* Develop your own features, or hire someone to do this for you

== How much does it cost? ==

Elgg is an open source product. Not all open source products are free to download, but Elgg is. That means, in its simplest form, Elgg costs nothing at all. This does not mean it's public domain: Elgg is released under the GNU Public License v2, which means the source code is licensed to you. With any software, it's always a good idea to read the license.

== What does Elgg stand for? ==

Truth, justice and freedom!

No, in all seriousness, Elgg doesn't stand for anything. It's named after [http://www.elgg.ch/de/ a town in Switzerland]. However, if you prefer this answer, it also means "moose" in many languages.

== Where does Elgg come from? ==

Elgg's initial funding was by a company called [http://curverider.co.uk/ Curverider], which was started by David Tosh and Ben Werdmuller.  Today, Elgg is a fully open source product protected and sponsored by [http://theelggfoundation.org The Elgg Foundation] and has a variety of contributors.

== How do you say Elgg? ==

[[Media:How_to_say_Elgg.mp3|Saying Elgg]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English /ˈɛlɡ/]) It sounds like "elk" with a hard or voiced "g."  It definitely does not sound like "Elj" or "Ee El Gee Gee."

== How do you write "Elgg?" ==

Elgg is written exactly like that: the 'E' in uppercase and the rest in lower.  It is also acceptable to be in all lowercase.  Elgg isn't an acronym, and there's no need to shout when writing, so please don't write "ELGG."  E-LGG is also wrong.

== Does Elgg require an article in English? ==

No.  "I'm using the Elgg" is a weird sentence.  Similarly, "Why not just install an Elgg!" sounds funny.

If "Elgg" is used as an adjective to describe a noun that requires an article, you would use one.  For example, in "I'm using '''the''' Elgg '''website,'''" the word "website" needs an article, so "the" is used before Elgg.
